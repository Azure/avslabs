# AVS LAB Automation

This repo has all necessary scripts and artifacts that you need to deploy AVS Lab with nested VMware-based environments.

> Nested virtualization is not supported by neither VMware nor Microsoft. It's used here for the sake of testing certain scenarios in Lab environment.

## Background

Deploying Azure VMware Solution (AVS) in Azure is feasible through multiple mechanisms (Portal/CLI/PowerShell). However, that alone is not enough to practice various exercises to become familiar with the service capabilities. There is a need for an on-premises VMware environment that has connectivity to the AVS private cloud. This, in fact, has been challenging to afford for the purpose of skilling as those resources typically cannot be provisioned on-demand for training or skilling purposes.

To address this issue, AVS Nested Labs has been introduced. It provides organizations and experts with a solution to overcome the challenge of not having an on-premises VMware-based environment for testing and skilling exercises to become more familiar with AVS. It is a fully-featured and isolated environment.

With AVS Nested Labs, you can set up a virtual environment that is similar to on-premises environment, without the need for physical hardware, and still be able to perform your tests and exercises in a safe and isolated environment.

Thus, the solution was to create automation package that will deploy AVS based on Enterprise Scale for Landing Zone templates and run PowerShell scripts that can provision **nested labs** within AVS Private Cloud to server the purpose of on-premises environment.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

  1) Azure CLI: You can download it from [here](http://aka.ms/azurecli).
  2) AVS 3-Node Quota available in an Azure Subscription.

### Before you deploy

  1) Decide if you want to deploy a [single](./bicep/ESLZDeploy.Single.LAB.deploy.bicep) AVS Private Cloud (SDDC) , or [multiple](./bicep/ESLZDeploy.LAB.deploy.bicep) AVS Private Clouds.
  2) Review the parameters file, that corresponds to your deployment, to make sure you have the right parameters for the deployment. In other words, this depends if you are just deploying a single AVS Private Cloud (SDDC) or multiple ones.
  3) Based on your choice, you can use the instructions in the section below to kick-off the deployment.

### Deployment

Here are the steps you need to take to deploy AVS Lab with nested VMware lab environments.

1. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository.

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/Azure/avslabs.git
   ```

2. Change directory to 'bicep' directory.

   ```powershell
   cd .\bicep\
   ```

3. Update Parameters File

   > Make sure to update the the parameter file with the right values, such as: **NumberOfAVSInstances**, **NumberOfNestedLabsInAVS**, **Prefix**, **Location**, **AlertEmails**, etc...

4. Execute the Deployment

   **From Azure CLI run the deployment command as in the following examples.**

   >Make sure to provide the a unique **name** for the deployment, the right **location**, your deployment choice **bicep file** and the corresponding **parameter file**.

   ```azurecli
   az deployment sub create -n "<deployment-unique-name" -l "<location>" -f "<bicep-template-file-name>" -p "<corresponding-parameter-file>" --no-wait
   ```

   As an example for **single lab** deployment:

   ```azurecli
   az deployment sub create -n "AVS-LAB-2023-02-15" -l "brazilsouth" -f "ESLZDeploy.Single.LAB.deploy.bicep" -p "ESLZDeploy.Single.LAB.deploy.bicep.parameters.json" --no-wait
   ```

   As an example for **multiple lab** deployment:

   ```azurecli
   az deployment sub create -n "AVS-LAB-2023-02-15" -l "brazilsouth" -f "ESLZDeploy.LAB.deploy.bicep" -p "ESLZDeploy.LAB.deploy.bicep.parameters.json" --no-wait
   ```

## What if I already have AVS deployed? Can I just provision the nested lab/s?

Yes, you can! ðŸ’¡

### What you will need?

1) AVS Private Cloud.
2) Jumpbox that can reach out to AVS.
3) System Assigned Managed Identity enabled on the Jumpbox.
4) **Assign the Jumpbox Managed Identity a Contributor Role over AVS Private Cloud**.
5) Download [bootstrap.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/avslabs/main/scripts/bootstrap.ps1) script and store it in **C:\Temp** directory.
   You can run the command below from Command Prompt to download **boostrap.ps1**:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "New-Item -Path C:\ -Name Temp -ItemType Directory -ErrorAction Ignore; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/avslabs/main/scripts/bootstrap.ps1 -OutFile C:\Temp\bootstrap.ps1; Unblock-File -Path C:\Temp\bootstrap.ps1"
```

### How to execute?

1) Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe).
2) Change directory to C:\Temp by running: cd c:\Temp
3) Validate that **bootstrap.ps1** exits and the file extension is **.ps1** not .txt for example
4) Run this command, but first make sure you setup the appropriate **GroupNumber** (keep it 1 if you are not sure), and required number of nested lab environments: **NumberOfNestedLabs**. 

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File bootstrap.ps1 -GroupNumber 1 -NumberOfNestedLabs 1
```

5) You can track progress by keeping an eye on **bootstrap.log** and **bootstrap-nestedlabs.log** which will be created in **C:\Temp** directory.

## Troubleshoot

### How to delete nested labs?

You may want to clean nested labs as they could have already consumed and you would like to start from scratch without redeploying AVS Private Cloud, or deploying the nested labs could have failed while you are deploying them, so you need to clean failed labs and start over. Here are the steps to do so:

1) Go to **vCenter** Portal -> **Inventory** view, then find the 'NestedLabs' **Resource Pool**.
2) Right click on the desired nested lab **vApp**. And **Power Off** all VMs that resides inside the **vApp**.

3) Delete the nested lab vApp; right-click and choose **Delete from Disk**.

4) Delete the Resource Pool 'NestedLabs'

5) Go to NSX-T Portal -> Go to Segments.
6) Delete any segments created for the NestedLabs (i.e.: Group-1-1-**NestedLab**)
